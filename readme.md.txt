# Car Dealers Data Project on Azure

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using car dealers data, leveraging various Azure services such as Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Databricks, Azure SQL Database, and Unity Catalog for data governance. The project includes data ingestion, transformation, and storage processes, as well as creating and managing data pipelines and workflows.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline to process car dealers' data, ensuring data quality, governance, and security. The project follows a structured approach to extract data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into a central data warehouse for analysis and reporting.

## Architecture

![Project Architecture](link-to-your-architecture-diagram)

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For orchestrating and automating data workflows.
- **Azure Databricks (ADB)**: For data transformation using PySpark and SQL.
- **Azure SQL Database**: For storing transformed data.
- **Unity Catalog in Databricks**: For data governance and metadata management.

## Key Features

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data ingestion from various sources using Azure Data Factory.
2. **Data Transformation**: Data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment using Azure Databricks.
3. **Data Storage**: Transformed data is stored in Azure SQL Database for further analysis.
4. **Data Governance**: Implemented using Unity Catalog in Databricks for secure and efficient data management.
5. **Pipelines and Workflows**: Pipelines in ADF and workflows in Databricks automate the entire process.

## Project Components

### 1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)

- **Pipelines**: Created pipelines to ingest data from on-premises and cloud sources.
- **Activities**: Utilized copy activity, data flow, and lookups for ETL processes.
- **Triggers**: Scheduled and event-based triggers to automate data workflows.

### 2. Azure Databricks

- **Notebooks**: Developed notebooks for data transformation using PySpark.
- **Delta Lake**: Leveraged Delta Lake for efficient data storage and versioning.
- **Workflows**: Set up workflows for end-to-end data processing within Databricks.

### 3. Azure SQL Database

- **Schema Design**: Designed normalized schema for storing processed data.
- **Queries**: Optimized SQL queries for data retrieval and reporting.

### 4. Unity Catalog in Databricks

- **Data Governance**: Implemented Unity Catalog for centralized metadata management.
- **Access Control**: Managed data access using role-based access controls (RBAC).
